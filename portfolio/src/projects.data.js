      "I designed and developed a web-based marketplace application which made use of MVC architecture. This app allows a user to create an account using password authentication and an avatar as well as CRUD functionality based on user permissions for functions such as adding properties, bookings and reviews. The project was my first solo project after the bootcamp and it allowed me to practice backend development using Ruby on Rails and database migration. Additionally, as I was responsible for the frontend as well, I was able to hone my CSS, HTML and Figma abilities during the project. The geolocation feature and database interdependencies were the most challenging aspects of the project.",
