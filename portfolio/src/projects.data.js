We worked in an interdisciplinary team of four, dividing the work between ourselves in order to put in to practice the fundamentals which we'd been learning on the course. My primary task was the backend of the website; creating the database using SQLite as well as creating and testing the user registration and login features.",

      "I designed and developed a web-based marketplace application which made use of MVC architecture. This app allows a user to create an account using password authentication and an avatar as well as CRUD functionality based on user permissions for functions such as adding properties, bookings and reviews. The project was my first solo project after the bootcamp and it allowed me to practice backend development using Ruby on Rails and database migration. Additionally, as I was responsible for the frontend as well, I was able to hone my CSS, HTML and Figma abilities during the project. The geolocation feature and database interdependencies were the most challenging aspects of the project.",
